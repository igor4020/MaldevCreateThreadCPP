# Clone and Open Git Repository with Visual Studio Solution

## Step 1: Clone the Git Repository

Clone the Git repository using the `git clone` command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/igor4020/MaldevCreateThreadCPP.git
```

## Step 2: Navigate to the Cloned Repository

```bash
cd MaldevCreateThreadCPP
```

## Step 3: Open Visual Studio Solution

Navigate to the directory containing the Visual Studio solution file (usually with a `.sln` extension). Use the `start` command on Windows to open Visual Studio with the solution:

```bash
start CreateThreadCpp.sln
```

If you are not on Windows or the `start` command doesn't work, you can open the solution file manually from the Visual Studio IDE.

## Step 8: Explore and Work

Visual Studio should now open with the solution loaded. You can explore the code, make changes, and work on the project.

That's it! You have successfully cloned and opened a Git repository with a Visual Studio solution.
